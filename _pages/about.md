I am delighted to present myself: My name is Arpan Poudel, currently a diligent second-year Master of Science in Computer Science student at the University of Arkansas. With a solid foundation in computer engineering from Tribhuvan University, my academic and professional journey is fueled by a profound passion for computer vision, underpinned by my engagement in pioneering research within generative models, image reconstruction, and medical image processing.

At the University of Arkansas as a Research Assistant has been marked by significant contributions to the field of lensless imaging, where I led a project that achieved a remarkable 1.35 times increase in image reconstruction accuracy. This endeavor not only honed my skills in sophisticated data analysis and machine learning but also allowed me to engineer a diffuser camera prototype, setting a new precedent in lensless imaging technology. Additionally, my role as a Teaching Assistant has enabled me to impart knowledge and foster enthusiasm among undergraduate students in computer science, further enriching my educational experience.

Outside the realm of academia and research, I enjoy diving into various hobbies that range from playing video games and cricket to indulging in fishing and exploring culinary arts. These activities not only serve as a source of relaxation and enjoyment but also inspire creativity and problem-solving skills in my professional work.

Leveraging my comprehensive skill set, achievements, and interdisciplinary expertise, I am keen to pursue opportunities that allow me to contribute to and innovate within the fields of computer vision and medical imaging. My ambition is to apply the knowledge and experiences garnered through my academic projects and research towards advancing technology in practical, impactful ways.
