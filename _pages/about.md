I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Arkansas under Dr. [Qinghua Li](https://csce.uark.edu/~qinghual/).  My work is in federated learning, large language models and medical imaging, with a focus on building reliable and privacy-preserving AI systems for healthcare.

## Research interests
- Vision–language models
- Generative models
- Image reconstruction
- Federated learning


## Current and recent projects

- **Federated vision–language modeling for chest X-rays.** I fine-tune `Qwen-VL` models with `LoRA` adapters and explore router/gating methods to choose adapters across clients without sharing data. I use structured report templates (e.g., *Findings* / *Impression*) to reduce hallucinations and improve clinical usefulness.

- **MRI super-resolution.** I developed an unsupervised diffusion approach that enhances low-resolution MRI without paired training data. I also released the **SRMRI** dataset with matched low-/high-resolution scans to enable fair benchmarking and to study scan-time reduction via super-resolution.


## Outside research
I enjoy cricket, video games, fishing, and cooking.

## Collaboration
I am open to collaborations in computer vision and medical imaging—especially projects that connect rigorous methods with real clinical needs.
