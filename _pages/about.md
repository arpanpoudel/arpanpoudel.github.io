I am thrilled to introduce myself: my name is Arpan Poudel, a second-year master's student with a background in computer science from the University of Arkansas. My academic pursuits have been motivated by my passion for the field of computer vision, especially in cutting-edge research areas like generative models, image reconstruction, and medical image processing. In the free time, I like playing video games, cricket, fishing and cooking.
