I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science under the supervision of Dr. Ukash Nakarmi at the University of Arkansas. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Pashchimanchal Campus, Tribhuvan University, Nepal in 2019. I joined the University of Arkansas in the spring of 2022.  His research interests widely include Machine learning, Deep learning, Natural language processing and Computer vision. In the free time, I like playing video games, cricket, fishing and cooking.
